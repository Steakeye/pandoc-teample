#Pandoc Template

Base template for using pandoc to generate html documents with custom css styling and separate markdown files for chapters

It's a way of writing markdown, and generating html or pdf files from the markdown; I tend to export html and then save to pdf in chrome!

_What's good about this approach?_

- You can use css to create consistent layout
- You can use LaTex notation for formulas
- You can separate your content, into seprate files for the individual chapters/sections
- It creates a table of contents automagically!
- You can export your references from RefWorks and the rerences the exported file in your yaml doc
  - After that it's trivial to reference a source from the list of references in the main body of your work
  - The formatting can be set to aoutmaticall render according to Westminster Harvard style
  - A reference section can be autogenerated at the end of the project
